##### (SaaS) software-as-a-service - based analytics platform | AI-based hybrid cloud assessment tool | Infrastructure recommendation engine | software-defined opportunity engine (SDOE) | Sizing engine |




> HPE CloudPhysics delivers data-driven insights for smarter IT decisions across edge-to-cloud, enabling IT to_ optimize application workload placement_, _procure right-sized infrastructure services_, and _lower costs_.

> It provides predictive analytics for _virtual datacenters_, that enable IT teams to proactively manage their virtualized infrastructures while reducing cost and risk. 

> The company’s SaaS-based offering collects machine metadata of virtualized infrastructure and, using Big Data analytics combined with uniquepatent-pending datacenter simulation and resource management techniques, uncovers hidden operational hazards before problems emerge and identifies radical improvements in resource utilization. 

> CloudPhysics’ unique approach to IT operations management gives IT teams more power than ever before to _understand, troubleshoot, and optimize their virtualized datacenters_.

> CloudPhysics continually develops simulations and predictions on trending across different use cases such as cluster space, resource consumption patterns, and performance. Exploration mode associates correlated events, identified issues and configuration changes with a selected “time slice” – all in a single-pane view.

> The platform_ simulates possible migrations_ to the various cloud platforms, estimating costs and viability, as well as modelling your exact infrastructure as a virtual environment, machine-by-machine, to provide the data you need to decide between cloud and on-premise infrastructures.

> In short, it is a SaaS-based tool that analyzes on-premises IT environments and provides quick return on investment recommendations for cloud migrations, application modernization and infrastructure.

## What data is used for the analytics platform?

> The platform ingests more than _200 usage metrics_ from virtual machines, physical servers, storage arrays, data stores and network infrastructure to determine where inefficiencies may exist. Based on this data, the platform generates personalized reports on resource utilization and how different technologies may remedy the situation.

> **The CloudPhysics data lake** -  includes more than 200 trillion data samples from more than 1 million virtual machines instances.

> **The Infosight data lake** - collects information from HPE’s massive installed base to automatically remediate infrastructure issues and has 1,250 trillion data points in a data lake that has been accumulated over more than a decade!
